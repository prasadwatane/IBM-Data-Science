This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow to predict rainfall using historical weather data. Leveraging the skills learned throughout the course, you will:

Explore and prepare the dataset: Perform feature engineering and data cleaning to enhance model input quality.

Build a classification pipeline: Select, train, and optimize machine learning models for accurate rainfall prediction.

Evaluate model performance: Analyze metrics and visualizations to interpret the effectiveness of your classifier.

Imagine yourself as a data scientist at WeatherTech Inc., tasked with developing a robust model that forecasts whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
